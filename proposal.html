      <h1>What is your website about?</h1>
      <p>
        The collection of Chinese students's up-to-date comments on Professors
        and classes. Now, we only have chat histories of a lot of chat groups to
        look into and find out related message. What if organize all the chats
        into a website?I think it would be much more straightforward and
        convenient.

      <h1>
        What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site
        be important?)
      </h1>
      <p>
        To give students ideas of the Professor or the class. Since most of
        Chinese students are active on WeChat to share feelings, the abundant
        feedbacks will be more objective and accurate than those on Rate my
        Professor.
      </p>
      <h1>Who is your target audience?</h1>
      <p>
        First, start with chinese students. If it works, we will open it to all
        the students.
      </p>
      <h1>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h1>
      <p>
        I want to category the classes and the Professors in five degree: Easy
        A. Learn most. YYDS. Ordinary and Disaster.
